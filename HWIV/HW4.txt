4.1
All #pragma declarations are private to NU32.c
NU32_DESIRED_BAUD is a defined constant that is meant to be used across other c files.
NU32_Startup() is a function meant to be used across other C files.

NU32_ReadUART3 and NU32_WriteUART3 are meant to be used in other C files. 

__builtin_disable_interupts() and __builtin_disable_interrupts() are meant to be used in other C files. 


4.2

a) Check NU32invest.c

b) All function prototypes should be put into helper.h, while all of the functions themselves should be placed into helper.c. The struct and main file are defined 
in invest.c itself. Because the prototypes reside within helper.h, an include guard should be placed at the top of the file in order to prevent said functions from
being defined multiple times throughout the project. 

c) I put the sendoutput and getinput functions in io.c, and I proceeded to make a io.h file with their prototypes and an include guard. I
also needed to include <stdio.h> within io.h, since the functions scan and print to thge screen.
I also mad a .h file for calculate.c, and it was within calculate.h that I defined the struct, since the calcualte function requires the struct.
I then called calculate.h in io.h. Finally, I defined the main function in invest4c.c, and I called both .h files. 


4.4
Check LCDwrite.c for clear function.
