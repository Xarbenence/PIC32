ME333 Introduction to Mechatronics
2022 Quiz 4: Chapter 3 Name Alex P. Sharper-Costilla

1. The PIC32 has four types of memory: data RAM, program flash, SFRs, and boot flash. Which
is cacheable, which is not? Why?

/*
 Program Flash, data RAM, and boot flash are all cacheable, but SFRs are not. This is because 
SFRs correspond to peripherals whose values are constantly updating. If their values were cached,
the CPU might read outdated SFR values.
*/

2. For the following SFR, how many implemented bitfields are there? After reset, which bitfields
are initially set?
/*
There are 2 implemented bitfields. Bitfields 1:4 and 13:15 are all initially set to F00F upon 
reset.



*/

3. What is the function of the processor.o file?

/*
This object file provides the virtual memory addresses for the PIC32's SFRs. 

*/


4. The prefetch module has a 128 bit wide path to Flash memory, but the rest of the bus matrix
inside the PIC32 is only 32 bits wide. Why?

/*

The CPU can only perform some 32-bit operations in a single clock cycle. The prefetch cache module's 128 bit wide path to Flash allows it to 
"run ahead" of the CPU's execution, predictively prefetching future instructions for the CPU so that they can be provided immediately
on the next cycle.
