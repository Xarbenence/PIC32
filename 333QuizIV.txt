1. What is the purpose of the NU32_Startup() function?

NU32_Startup() configures the PIC32 and NU32 library. It sets the prefetch cache module and 
flash wait cycle to run at the maxiumum speed. It enables interrupts on the PIC32 but disables JTAG
debugging so that said pins are able to be used for other purposes. RF0 and RF1 are configured as ditial outputs to 
control LED1 and LED2, respectively. It also enables UART3 for communication with a computer. 

2. Why doesn’t the following command work as intended?
LCD_WriteString(“Hello world 12345678”)

The Hitachi that we use is only a 16x2 LCD screen, but the input string contains more than 16 characters, so it would roll-over and write over itself. 


3. What does the command line instruction make clean do?

"make clean"  removes files created after the "make" command has been used, such as .hex, .elf, .dis, .map, and .o files.
